# **OBJECTIVE**

Diligent college student, currently enrolled at Lehigh University, who is striving to leverage my knowledge and understanding of business through the study of finance and to work towards obtaining the opportunity to put that gained knowledge to use through internships and jobs in the business field in order to make a positive impact on the world and to become successful.

# **EDUCATION**

Currently enrolled in my first year at Lehigh University and planning to pursue a major in finance. I graduated high school in the top 10% of my class with an unweighted GPA of 96.8 and a weighted GPA of 101.3 while completing multiple college-level and advanced placement courses prior to entering college. I am starting my education in finance at Lehigh University by being enrolled and attending core classes in business to jump start my education in business early on in my college career.

# **EXPERIENCE**

1.     NYC Ladders for Leaders Internship

_Participant_

Having the opportunity to participate in this internship-based program in New York City over the summer of 2018 gave me valuable knowledge and skills that would follow me both int college and into my future occupation: leadership development, college readiness, time management, communication, working within teams of new people. This program also gave me the insight as to what the daily operations are within large business in the metropolitan area through various workshops and panels.

2.     Newfield High School DECA Club

_Vice President/Member_

As both vice president and member of my high school&#39;s DECA organization, I gained valuable knowledge early on in my career as to what a business oriented lifestyle entitles and also provided me with a valuable leadership position that has given me the experience to know what it is like to be held responsible for overseeing the production of something and to have some authority to make sure that a group of individuals can go on to be as successful as possible.

3.     Stop and Shop Supermarket Company

_Customer Service Department Head_

Through my position as a customer service department head, I had to be able to effectively communicate with customers about any concerns or problems they may have, while also always striving to work towards making all of the customers&#39; experiences in the store a positive one. This position allowed me to gain crucial communication skills and also gave me the opportunity to learn how to work with different people who brought in various types of skills and work together efficiently which is a big part of working in a business.

4.     National Honor Society

_President_

During my senior year of high school, I was nominated and voted to hold the position of president within my school&#39;s chapter of National Honor Society. This position required me to work with a group of my peers to coordinate events that took place within the community of my school. By holding this position, I was able to gain the experience of working with a diverse group of people and had to learn how to properly communicate and to make sure that what needed to be achieved at each meeting was done properly and effectively and to make sure that I held my peers responsible for what they were required to take part in at every community event we held, and to make sure that I was doing my own job properly to make sure that the events our chapter held ran smoothly.
